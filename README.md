# Stock_Prediction

## Overview
Stock_Prediction is a GitHub repository dedicated to the implementation and demonstration of various stock price prediction techniques. This project explores multiple algorithms and models for forecasting stock market trends using machine learning, deep learning, and statistical analysis.

## Features
- Implements a variety of stock prediction models (Machine Learning & Deep Learning)
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for financial time-series
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Visualization of predictions versus real data

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch (for deep learning)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- pip or conda

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/meakashmalik/Stock_Prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Stock_Prediction
    ```
3. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
4. Install required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the repository, following usage instructions provided in each notebook. Typical workflow includes:
- Loading and preprocessing stock market data
- Training models to predict stock prices
- Evaluating predictions against real data
- Visualizing results
